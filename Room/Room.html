    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p> Professor Eno is the teacher of computer informational systems at pinkerton academy. 
        Professor Eno has many other titles but this site in particular is developed by Lantis Hegg and Connor Schuler for use of the CIS room. 
        This website contains useful links, relevant information, links to documentation of the room, and other things to help improve the workflow of those within the room. 
        The class Computer Informational Systems is basically IT, networking, cybersecurity classes all rolled into one. 
        We have access to a lot of equipment and have a lot of say in what goes on in the room. 
        Generally we work on side projects to help us understand or play with computers better.
        Such as this very website.
        We also do Testout, CompTIA, and Cisco which gives us all sorts of certifications depending on what we want to do. 
        For those interested in our work please reach out to Professor Eno at <a href="mailto:Meno@pinkertonacemy.org">Meno@pinkertonacademy.org</a>
